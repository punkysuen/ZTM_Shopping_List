ZTM - Complete Web Developer in 2025: Zero to Mastery - Exercise: DOM Events

I tried to use Grok as assistantce for this exercise, and I found the result is great.

I did not ask for the whole solution. Rather, I first post my own failed solution and let Grok to review. It told me why my solution failed but gave the solution I was not able to fully understand.

Then, I told it to modify my solution as little as possible, that was in the range of my knowledge and understandling level.
